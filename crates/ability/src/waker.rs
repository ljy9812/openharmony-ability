//! Event-loop waker for the OHOS runtime integration layer.
//!
//! This module provides the `OpenHarmonyWaker` — a `ThreadsafeFunction` wrapper
//! that, when called from any thread, schedules a no-op callback on the NAPI
//! main thread, waking the event loop. The `WAKER` global stores the TSFN
//! singleton, initialized once during ability lifecycle setup (`lifecycle.rs`)
//! and read live by `OpenHarmonyWaker::wake()` whenever the embedding runtime's
//! event-loop proxy needs to wake the main thread.
//!
//! Role: runtime integration layer infrastructure. The event loop proxy needs
//! a cross-thread wake mechanism; OHOS NAPI TSFN is the only available primitive.
//! All access is main-thread-only; the global is accepted as a persistent
//! integration seam.
//!
//! # Why `wake()` reads `WAKER` live (not a construction-time snapshot)
//!
//! `WAKER` is populated by `create_lifecycle_handle` (lifecycle.rs), which runs
//! *after* the embedding runtime's entry point that constructs the event-loop proxy (and thus
//! calls `create_waker`) during the `#[ability]` `init` sequence. A snapshot
//! captured at construction time would therefore be `None` permanently — `wake()`
//! would be a silent no-op, the runtime's user-event variant would never fire, and async
//! plugin command responses (resolved on tokio worker threads →
//! `send_user_message` non-main-thread branch → `proxy.send_event` + `wake()`)
//! would never be drained on the main thread → JS Promises never settle →
//! 5000ms test timeouts. Reading `WAKER` live at `wake()` time sidesteps the
//! ordering: by the time any worker-thread command resolves, lifecycle setup
//! has long since populated `WAKER`.
