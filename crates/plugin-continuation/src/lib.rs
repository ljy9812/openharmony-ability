//! App continuation facade (passive restore side).
//!
//! OHOS app continuation is lifecycle-driven: on the target device the system
//! launches the ability with `launchParam.launchReason === CONTINUATION` and the
//! source device's `wantParam` in `want.parameters`. `NativeAbility.onCreate` /
//! `onNewWant` forward that signal (as the boolean `isContinuation`, never a raw
//! enum number) into the lifecycle closures, which store it in the app's
//! session state (`OpenHarmonyAppInner`, since issue #87 major-9) — the same
//! pattern the deep-link cold-start path uses.
//!
//! This facade is a **pure synchronous** reader of that state: no bridge
//! plugin, no ArkTS action, no main-thread dispatch. Active migration (source
//! device initiating hand-off) is system-UI-exclusive on OHOS and is not
//! covered. Source-side state saving goes through
//! [`ContinuationClient::set_continuation_data`]: the snapshot is stored in the
//! process-level `CONTINUATION_SNAPSHOT` global and read synchronously by the
//! ArkTS `onContinue` callback (via the `read_continue_snapshot` NAPI export)
//! when the system initiates a migration.
